Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

1. Nature and Initialization
* References:
    * A reference is essentially an alias for another variable. Once a reference is initialized to a variable, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable.
    * A reference must be initialized at the time of declaration. It cannot be null and must refer to a valid object or variable.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int &ref = i; // ref is now an alias for i
* Pointers:
    * A pointer is an object that stores the memory address of another variable. A pointer can be reassigned to point to different variables or can be set to `nullptr`.
    * A pointer can be initialized to `nullptr` or it can be left uninitialized. It can also be set to point to any object of the appropriate type.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int *ptr = &i; // ptr points to i
2. Reassignment
* References:
    * Once a reference is bound to a variable, it cannot be made to refer to another variable. It is fixed and cannot be changed.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int j = 20;
        int &ref = i; // ref refers to i 
        ref = j; // This assigns the value of j to i, not reassigns ref 
* Pointers:
    * A pointer can be reassigned to point to different variables of the same type during its lifetime.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int j = 20;
        int *ptr = &i; // ptr points to i 
        ptr = &j; // ptr now points to j
3. Dereferencing
* References:
    * Accessing the value through a reference does not require dereferencing. You can use the reference directly as if it were the original variable.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int &ref = i;
        int value = ref; // value is now 10
* Pointers:
    * To access the value a pointer is pointing to, you must explicitly dereference the pointer using the `*` operator.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int *ptr = &i;
        int value = *ptr; // value is now 10
4. Nullability
* References:
    * References cannot be null. They must always refer to a valid object, making them safer to use in contexts where nullability could lead to errors.
* Pointers:
    * Pointers can be null (`nullptr`), meaning they may not always point to a valid object. This can be useful but requires careful handling to avoid dereferencing null pointers.
5. Memory Address 
* References:
    * You cannot get the memory address of a reference itself because a reference is not an object; it is just another name for an already existing object.
* Pointers:
    * A pointer has its own memory address where the address of the variable it points to is stored. You can take the address of the point itself if needed.
    * Example:
        int i = 10;
        int *ptr = &i;
        int **ptr_to_ptr = &ptr; // ptr_to_ptr points to the pointer ptr
Summary
* References are more like constant pointers that automatically dereference and cannot be null or reassigned after Initialization.
* Pointers are objects that can hold memory addresses, can be reassigned, can be null, and need to be explicitly dereferenced to access the value they point to.
Both references and pointers have their unique uses, and understanding when to use each is crucial in C++.
