Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.

int i = 0;
(a) double* dp = &i; is illegal because of the type difference between the pointer dp (`double`) and the address of `i` (`int`).
(b) int *ip = i; this is illegal because it attempts to initialize pointer `ip` to an `int` value rather than a valid memory address.
(c) int *p = &i is a legal definition that initializes integer pointer `p` to the address of integer `i`.
