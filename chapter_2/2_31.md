For the declarations from 2_30.txt, determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level `const` applies in each case.
From 2_30.txt:
const int v2 = 0;             // v2 is a const int
int v1 = v2;                  // v1 is a non-const int
int *p1 = &v1;                // p1 is a non-const pointer to a non-const int
int &r1 = v1;                 // r1 is a non-const reference to a non-const int
const int *p2 = &v2;          // p2 is a pointer to a const int
const int *const p3 = &i;     // p3 is a const pointer to a const int
const int &r2 = v2;           // r2 is a const reference to a const int

r1 = v2; // r1 is a regular reference, v2 is a `const int`. This is illegal: in order to reference a `const int`, you must use a `const` reference. Top-level `const` in `v2` prevents modification through a non-const reference.
p1 = p2; // p1 is a regular pointer, p2 is a `const int` pointer pointing to a `const int`. This is illegal: a regular pointer (non-const pointer) cannot point to a const int* (a pointer to a const int). This would violate the const correctness by potentially allowing modification of a const object. Low-level `const` in `p2` prevents assigning it to `p1`.
p2 = p1; // p2 is a `const int` pointer pointing to a `const int`, p1 is a regular pointer. This is legal: a const int* (a pointer to a const int) can point to an int* (a regular pointer to an int). This is safe because it means that the const int* will treat the int as const, even though the original int is not const. This ensures that the const contract is upheld: you won't accidentally modify the value through the const int*. Low-level `const` in `p2` allows it to treat the `int` as `const`, even though `p1` does not.
p1 = p3; // p1 is a regular pointer, p3 is a `const int const` pointer. This is illegal: a regular pointer (int*) cannot point to a const int* const pointer because it would violate const correctness by potentially allowing modifications to const data and altering a const pointer's behavior. Low-level `const` in `p3` prevents assign it to `p1`.
p2 = p3; p2 is a `const int` pointer, p3 is a `const int const` pointer. This is legal: a poiner to a `const int` can point to a `const int* const`. Low-level `const` in both `p2` and `p3` ensures that the `const int` is treated as `const`, and the assignment is valid.
