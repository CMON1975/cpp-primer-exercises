Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make it legal?
int null = 0, *p = null; // `int null = 0;` is perfectly fine. It declares an integer variable `null` and initializes it to `0`. `*p = null;` is problematic because `p` is a pointer to an `int`, but `null` is an `int`, not a pointer. You cannot directly assign an integer to a pointer without a type mismatch error. If the intention is to make `p` a null pointers (i.e., a pointer that points to no object), you should assign `nullptr` to `p` instead of `null`. Alternatively, assigning the address of `null` to the pointer p would be correct: int null = 0, *p = &null;
