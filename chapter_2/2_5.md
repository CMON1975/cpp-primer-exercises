Determine each type of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

(a) 'a' is a character literal of the type `char`. It represents a single character in a narrow (1-byte) character set (usually ASCII or similar)
    L'a' is a wide character literal of the type `wchat_t`. It represents a single character in a wide (multi-bye) character set, often used for Unicode characters.
    "a" is a string litereal of type `const char[]`. It represents an array of characters (including the null terminator `\0`). In this case, it's a string with a single character and a null terminator.
    L"a" is a wide string literal of type `const wchar_t[]`. It represents an array of wide characters, including a null terminator. It is used for strings that may contain wide characters.'

    Differences: The main difference is between narrow and wide chara/strings. Narrow literals are used for standard ASCII characters, while wide literals are intended for Unicode or other extended character sets.

(b) 10 is a decimal integer literal of type `int`.
    10u is an unsigned decimal integer literal of type `unsigned int`.
    10L is a long integer literal of type `long`.
    10uL is an unsigned long integer literal of type `unsigned long`.
    012 is an octal integer literal of type `int`. The leading `0` indicates it's in octal (base 8). In this case, `012` is equivalent to `10` in decimal.
    0xC is a hexadecimal integer literal of type `int`. The `0x` prefix indicates it's in hexadecimal (base 16). `0xC` is equivalent to `12` in decimal.

    Differences: The differences lie in the numerical base (decimal, octal, hexadecimal) and the type (signed vs. unsigned, regular vs. long). The prefixes (`0`, `0x`) and suffixes (`u`, `L`) modify the type or interpretation of the integer literal.

(c) 3.14 is a double-precision floating-point literal of type `double`.
    3.14f is a single-precision floating-point literal of type `float`. The `f` suffix explicitly sets the type to `float`.
    3.14L this is an extended-precision floating-point literal of type `long double`. The `L` suffix dests the type to `long double`.

    Differences: The difference here is the precision and type of the floating-point literal. `double` is the default, `float` is lower precision, and `long double` offers extended precision (depending on the implementation).

(d) 10 is a decimal integer literal of type `int`.
    10u is an unsigned decimal integer literal of type `unsigned int`.
    10. is a floating-point literal of type `double`. The presence of the decimal point (`.`) makes it a floating-point literal.
    10e-2 is a floating-point literal of type `double`, representing `10 * 10^(-2)` or `0.1`. The `e-2` notation specifies an exponent.

    Differences: The main differences are between integer and floating-point types. The decimal point or exponent (`e`) makes a literal floating-point rather than an integer. The `u` suffix distinguishes between signed and unsigned integers.
