Explaing the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain what's wrong and how to correct it.

(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
Illegal. You cannot declare a variable inline within an expression like this. The variable `input_value` needs to be declared seperately before using it with `std::cin`.
Corrected code:
int input_value;
std::cin >> input_value;

(b) int i = { 3.14 };
Illegal (with narrowing). This is an example of list initialization in C++. When using list initialization (curly braces), the compiler checks for "narrowing conversions," which are conversions where there is a risk of data loss. Since `3.14` is a `double` and `i` is an `int`, this results in a narrowing conversion.
Corrected code: If the intention is to store `3.14` in an integer, which truncates the decimal part, you can either use regular initialization or explicitly cast the value.
int i = 3.14; // Regular initialization (allowed ,but loses the fractional part)
// OR
int = static_cast<int>(3.14); // Explicit cast (legal and explicit)

(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
Illegal (if `wage` is undeclared). The code assumes that `wage` is already declared. If `wage` is not declared, the code is illegal. The statement attempts to assign `9999.99` to `wage`, then assign the result to `salary`. If `wage` is declared as a `double`, the statement is legal.
Corrected code: Ensure that `wage` is declared before this line.
double wage;
double salary = wage = 9999.99;

(d) int i = 3.14;
Legal (with truncation). This statement is legal in C++, but it involves a type conversion. The `double` value `3.14` will be truncated to the integer value `3`, losing the fractional part. This is a narrowing conversaion, but it is allowed in regular initialization.
No correction needed unless the truncation is undesired. If you want to prevent this, you could use list initialization, which will trigger a compiler error:
int i = { 3.14 }; // Triggers an error due to narrowing (see b above).
