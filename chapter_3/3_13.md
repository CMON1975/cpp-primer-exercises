**Exercise 3.13:** How many elements are there in each of the following `vectors`? What are the values of the elements?
(a) `vector<int> v1;` Default initialization for `int` elements, `v1` is empty.
(b) `vector<int> v2(10);` There are 10 `int` elements, each with value 0.
(c) `vector<int> v3(10, 42);` There are 10 `int` elements, each with the value 42.
(d) `vector<int> v4{10};` There is 1 `int` element with the value 10.
(e) `vector<int> v5{10, 42};` There are 2 `int` elements: the first of value 10 and the second of value 42.
(f) `vector<string> v6{10};` There are 10 default-initalized `string` elements of `""`.
(g) `vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};` There are 10 `string` elements all initialized to `"hi"`.
