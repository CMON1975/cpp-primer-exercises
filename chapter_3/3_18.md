**Exercise 3.18:** Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?
```
vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;
```
Is this illegal? The `vector ivec` has been initialized without values, meaning `ivec[0]` is undefined, and we cannot use subscripting to *create* vector entities, only to assign.

Instead, using `push_back()` would add the value to the vector:
```
vector<int> ivec;
ivec.push_back(42);
```
