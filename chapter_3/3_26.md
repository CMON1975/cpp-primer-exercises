**Exercise 3.26:** In this binary search program:
```
// text must be sorted
// beg and end will denote the range we're searching
auto beg = text.begin(), end = text.end();
auto mid = text.begin() + (end - beg)/2; // original midpoint
// while there are still elements to look at and we haven't yet found sought
while (mid != end && *mid != sought) {
    if (sought < *mid)      // is the element we want in the first half?
        end = mid;          // if so, adjust the range to ignore the second half
    else                    // the element we want is in the second half
        beg = mid + 1;      // start looking with the element just after mid
    mid = beg + (end - beg)/2;  // new midpoint
}
```
why did we write `mid = beg + (end - beg)/2;` instead of `mid = (beg + end)/2;`?

**Answer:** Iterators *cannot* be added directly.
### 1. Iterator Arithmetic: 
* `beg` and `end` are **iterators**, not integers. In C++, you can't add two iterators together (`beg + end`), because that operation doesn't make sense: the iterators represent positions in a container, not numeric values.
* However, you **can** subtract iterators (`end - beg`), which gives the number of elements between them. This is the numebr of steps you need to go from `beg` to `end`.
* After subtracting `end - beg`, you divide by 2 to find the middle of the range, and then add that result to `beg` to get the midpoint iterator.
### 2. Why `beg + (end - beg) / 2` Works:
* `end - beg` computes the distance (a numerical value) between the two iterators.
* Dividing the distance by 2 gives you the "halfway point" between `beg` and `end`.
* Adding that result to `beg` (`beg + (end - beg)/2`) moves the iterator `beg` forward by that distance, resulting in the iterator `mid` pointing to the middle of the range.
### 3. Why `mid = (beg + end) / 2` Doesn't Work:
* Since `beg` and `end` are iterators, you can't directly add them (`beg + end`). C++ doesn't define addition for iterators. You can think of iterators as pointers to elements, and it doesn't make sense to add to pointers together.
**Example:**
Imagine you have a sorted vector:
`std::vector<int> text = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};`
* `beg` is an iterator to `1` (the first element).
* `end` is an iterator to one past `11` (the end of the container).
* To find the midpoint:
    * You subtract `end - beg`, which gives the number of elements (6).
    * Divide by 2, (resulting in 3), and then move `beg` forward by 3 elements to get the midpoint.

In contrast, `beg + end` would be meaningless, as it tries to add two iterators, which isn't a valid operation.
**Conclusion:**
We use `mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2` to correctly compute the midpoint in iterator arithmetic. This method works because subtraction of iterators yields a numeric distance, which can then be added back to the starting iterator to get the correct midpoint.
