**Exercise 3.27**: Assuming `txt_size` is a function that takes no arguments and returns an `int` value, which of the following definitions are *illegal*? Explain why.
`unsigned buf_size = 1024;`
(a) `int ia[buf_size];`
* **Illegal**.
* The size of the array must be a constant expression at compile time. Here, `buf_size` is not a constant; it's a variable initialized to `1024`. Even though its value is known at runtime, it's not a compile-time constant, so this array definition is illegal.
(b) `int ia[4 * 7 - 14];`
* **Legal**.
* The expression `4 * 7 - 14` is a constant expression, and it evaluates to `14`, which is a valid array size. Therefore, this definition is legal.
(c) `int ia[txt_size()];`
* **Illegal**.
* Similar to (a), `txt_size()` is a function call, and the result of this function is not known at compile time. The size of an array in C++ must be a constant expression, so this array definition is illegal.
(d) `char st[11] = "fundamental";`
* **Illegal**.
* `"fundamental"` has 12 characters when we include the null terminator (`\0`), but the array `st` is only of size 11. This leads to an array size mismatch, as the string `"fundamental"` cannot fit into an array of size 11. Therefore, this definition is illegal.
## Summary of Legality: 
* (a) Illegal: `buf_size` is not a constant expression.
* (b) Legal: `4 * 7 - 14` is a constant expression.
* (c) Illegal: `txt_size()` is not a constant expression.
* (d) Illegal: String literal size exceeds the array size.
