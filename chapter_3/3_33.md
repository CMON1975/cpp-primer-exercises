**Exercise 3.33:** What would happen if we didn't initialize the `scores` array in the following code?
```
// count the number of grades by clusers of ten: 0--9, 10--19, ... 90--99, 100
unsigned scores[11] = {};   // 11 buckets, all initialized to 0
unsigned grade;
while (cin >> grade) {
    if (grade <= 100)
        ++scores[grade/10]; // increment the counter for the current cluster
}

for (auto i : scores)       // for each counter in scores
    cout << i << " ";       // print the value of that counter
cout << endl;
```
If you didn't initialize the `scores` array in the code, the values of the array elements would be **indeterminate**. In C++, when you declare an array like this without an explicit initializer:
`unsigned scores[11]; // no initialization`
* **Unitialized Variables:** Without initialization, the elements of the `scores` array will contain whatever values happen to exist at that memory location. These values are not guaranteed to be zero or any other predictable value.
* **Undefined Behavior:** When you attempt to increment an uninitialized value with `++scores[grade/10]`, you would be incrementing garbage values. This can lead to incorrect results when the program runs, and the output of the counters may be unpredictable.

## What would happen if we run the code with an unitialized `scores` array?
* **Garbage Values: Each bucket in the `scores` array might contain some random value from memory, resulting in counters starting from those indeterminate values instead of `0`.
* **Wrong Output:** The output would likely be incorrect, as you're working with non-zero, arbitrary initial values.
## Conclusion
If you don't initialize the `scores` array, the bheavior of your program becomees unpredictable due to the unitialized values in the array. Initializing the array to zero (as in the original code) ensures correct behavior, where each counter starts at zero and increments as grades are processed.
