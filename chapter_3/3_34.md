**Exercise 3.34:** Given that `p1` and `p2` point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of `p1` or `p2` that make this code illegal?
`p1 += p2 - p1;`
### Step-by-step breakdown:
- `p2-p1`: This calculates the number of elements between `p2` and `p1` in the array. If effectively gives an integer value representing how far `p2` is from `p1`. If `p2` is ahead of `p1` in the array, the result is positive; if `p2` is behind, the result is negative. If `p2` and `p1` are the same, the result is zero.
- `p1 += (p2 - p1)`: This adds the result of `p2 - p1` to `p1`. Essentially, it shifts `p1` by the difference between `p1` and `p2`. After this operation, `p1` will become equal to `p2`.

### Behavior:
This code moves `p1` to the same location as `p2` within the array. In essence, no matter where `p1` was originally, it ends up pointing to the same element as `p2`.

### Legality:
This code is legal as long as `p1` and `p2` both point to elements within the same array or one past the last element of the array (which is allowed by the standard, though dereferencing that pointer is not allowed).
However, if either `p1` or `p2` point outside the bounds of the array (besides the one-past-the-end case), this would result in undefined behavior. For example:
- If `p1` or `p2` point to elements from different arrays.
- If `p1` or `p2` point to memory outside the valid range of the array.

In summary, the code adjusts `p1` to point to the same element as `p2`, and it's legal as long as both pointers are valid and point within the bounds of the same array. If they point outside the bounds, the behavior becomes undefined.
