**Exercise 4.1:** What is the value returned by `5 + 10 * 20 / 2`?

According to C++ Precedence and Associativity rules we evaluate `10 * 20` first, yielding 200. We then divide this result by `2`, which gives us 100. Finally, we add `5` for the return result of `105`.

**Explanation:** By C++ operator precedence rules, multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) have higher precedence than addition (`+`). These operations are also left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right when they have the same precedence.
