**Exercise 4_2:** Using the C++ precedence rules, parenthsize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:
(a) `* vec.begin()`

**Answer:** Member selector (`.`) precedes dereference (`*`). `* (vec.begin())`.

(b) `* vec.begin() + 1`

**Answer:** Member selector (`.`) precedes dereference (`*`), which both precede add (`+`). `(* (vec.begin())) + 1`.
