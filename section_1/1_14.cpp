// Use Cases:
// For Loop: Use when the number of iterations is known beforehand (e.g., iterating over an array).
// While Loop: Use when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being met during the loop execution (e.g., reading data until the end of a file).
// Choosing between a for loop and a while loop depends on the specific requirements of the task and which loop structure makes the code more readable and maintainable.
