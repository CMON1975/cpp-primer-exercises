What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
An int is a 32-bit integer. A long is a 32-bit integer. A long long is a 64-bit integer. A short is a 16-bit integer. The specific ranges of these types varies, from 0 to x (see size_test.cpp)

Between and unsigned and signed type?
An unsigned type can only hold positive values, from zero to the maximum for that type. A signed type can hold negative values, from negative to positive maximums.
Types are signed by default. Declaring an unsigned variable has some utility, in that it doubles its maximum. It is also useful for binary/bitwise operations, as 
there is guaranteed no sign bit.

Between a float and a double?
A float is a single-precision floating-point value, with a minimum of 6 significant digits. 
A double is a double-precision floating-point value, with a minimum of 10 significant digits.
Of note: the double double can be used to measure the diameter of the observable universe (approx. 93 x 10^9 light-years, or 8.80 x 10^26 meters)
