Explain wherer each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
(a) extern int ix = 1024; is a definition, as it defines a value to the variable `ix`.
(b) int iy; is a declaration and a definition, as it names the variable `iy` and initializes the value as 0.
(c) extern int iz; is a declaration, as the keyword extern explicitly declares the existence of a variable `iz` without defining it.
