Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
(a) int double = 3.14; is invalid as double is a C++ keyword.
(b) int _; is valid so long as it is defined within a function, as it only contains one non-consecutive underscore.
(c) int catch-22; is invalid, as `-` is the minus operator.
(d) int 1_or_2 = 1; is invalid, as variable names cannot start with a digit.
(e) double Double = 3.14; is valid as keywords are case-sensitive in C++ and Double is not a keyword.
