Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.
int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
(a) r2 = 3.14159; Valid, sets `d` to `3.14159`.
(b) r2 = r1; Valid, sets `d` to the value of `i`, but as a `double`.
(c) i = r2; Valid, with truncation.
(d) r1 = d; Valid, sets `i` to `0` with truncation.
