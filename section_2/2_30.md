For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level `const`.
const int v2 = 0; This is top-level `const`. The variable `v2` is a constant integer, meaning the value of `v2` cannot be changed after it's initialized.
int v1 = v2; `v1` is not `const`, so this does not involve any `const` qualification. It simply initializes `v1` with the value of `v2`.

int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1; There is no `const` here, so neither top-level nor low-level `const` is involved. `p1` is a regular pointer to an `int` and `r1` is a reference to an `int`.

const int *p2 = &v2; // This is low-level `const`. `p2` is a pointer to a `const int`, meaning you can't modify the value of the `int` through `p2`. However, the pointer itself (`p2`) is not `const`, so it can point to different addresses.
const int *const p3 = &i; // This involves both top-level `const` and low-level `const`: Top-level `const`: `p3` is a constant pointer, meaning you cannot change the address that `p3` holds after it is initialized. Low-level `const`: `p3` is a pointer to a `const int`, meaning you cannot modify the value at the address `p3` points to.
const int &r2 = v2; // This is low-level `const`. `r2` is a reference to a `const int`, meaning the value referred to by `r2` cannot be modified through `r2`.
