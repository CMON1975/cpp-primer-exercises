In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:
int a = 3, b = 4; // both `a` and `b` are regular `int` variables. `a` holds the integer value `3` and `b` holds the integer value `4`.
decltype(a) c = a; // `c` is an `int` variable. 
decltype((b)) d = a; // `d` is an `int` reference to `a` due to the double parenthesis around `b`.
++c; // the value of `c` is now 4.
++d; // the value of `a`, and thus `d`, is now 5.
