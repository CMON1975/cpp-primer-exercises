Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if `i` is an `int`, then the type of the expression `i = x` is `int&`. Using that knowledge, determing the type of each variable in this code:
int a = 3, b = 4; // both `a` and `b` are `int` type variables.
decltype(a) c = a; // `c` is an `int` type variable as deduced by the `decltype` of `a`.
decltype(a = b) d = a; // `d` is a reference to an `int` type variable `a` as deduced by the `decltype` of `a = b` (an expression that evaluates to `int&`).
