Describe the differences in type deduction between `decltype` and `auto`. Give an example of an expression where `auto` and `decltype` will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce different types.
The differences in type deduction between `decltype` and `auto` primarily stem from how each keyword interprets the contex of the expression it's applied to:
`auto` Type Deduction:
* Rules:
    * `auto` deduces the type of a variable based on the initializer's value.
    * It generally strips away references and `const` qualifiers unless the initializer is a reference or pointer.
* Behavior:
    * `auto` treats the initializer as an expression and deduces the type as if you were declaring a non-reference, non-const variable unless you explicitly specify `auto&` or `auto&&`
`decltype` Type Deduction:
* Rules:
    * `decltype` deduces the exact type of an expression, including references and `const` qualifiers.
    * It returns the type exactly as the expression appears in the code. If the expression is an lvalue, `decltype` will return a reference type.
Examples:
Example where `auto` and `decltype` deduce the same type:
    int x = 5;
    auto a = x;     // `a` is of type `int`
    decltype(x) b = x; // `b` is of type `int`
* Explanation:
    * In this case, both `auto` and `decltype` deduce `int` because `x` is an `int`, and the context doesn't involve references or const qualifiers.
Example where `auto` and `delctype` deduce different types:
    int y = 10;
    int& ref = y;

    auto c = ref;   // `c` is of type `int`
    decltype(ref) d = ref; // `d` is of type `int&`
* Explanation:
    * `auto c = ref;` deduces `c` as `int` because `auto` strips the reference from `ref`.
    * `decltype(ref) d = ref;` deduces `d` as `int&` because `decltype` preserves the exact type of `ref`, which is a reference to `int`.
Summary of Differences:
* `auto`: Often simplifies type declarations by deducing the type of the initializer as a non-reference, non-const type unless specified otherwise.
* `decltype`: Provides the exact type of the expression, including references and const qualifiers, without stripping them away.

These differences are crucial when dealing with references, pointers, and const-correctness in C++.
