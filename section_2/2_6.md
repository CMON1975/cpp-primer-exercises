What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
    int month = 9, day = 7;
    int month = 09, day = 07;

The difference between the two definitions lies in how the integer literals are interpreted:

### First Definition:
```cpp
int month = 9, day = 7;
```
- **`month = 9`**: The value `9` is a standard decimal integer literal. It is assigned to `month`.
- **`day = 7`**: The value `7` is also a standard decimal integer literal. It is assigned to `day`.

Both `9` and `7` are treated as regular base-10 integers.

### Second Definition:
```cpp
int month = 09, day = 07;
```
- **`month = 09`**: The value `09` has a leading `0`, which in C++ indicates an octal (base-8) integer literal. However, `9` is not a valid digit in the octal system, so this will cause a **compile-time error**.
- **`day = 07`**: The value `07` is a valid octal integer literal because the digits `0-7` are valid in the octal system. The octal value `07` is equivalent to `7` in decimal.

### Summary:
- **`09`** is invalid in the second definition because `9` is not a valid octal digit, leading to a compile-time error.
- **`07`** is valid and will be interpreted as an octal literal in the second definition, but it represents the same value as `7` in decimal.

In contrast, the first definition has no issues because both `9` and `7` are treated as standard decimal integers.
