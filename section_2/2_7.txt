What values do these literals represent?
(a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"
(b) 3.14e1L (c) 1024f (d) 3.14L

Let's examine each of these literals to determine their values:

(a) `"Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"`
This is a string literal that includes escape sequences. Let's break it down:
- `"Who goes with F`: This part of the string is straightforward text.
- `\145`: This is an octal escape sequence. `\145` in octal represents the ASCII character 'e' (which is 101 in decimal).
- `rgus?`: This is regular text.
- `\012`: This is another octal escape sequence. `\012` in octal represents the newline character (`\n`), which is ASCII code 10 in decimal.

So, the string literal `"Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"` is equivalent to:
- `"Who goes with Fergus?\n"`

This represents the string: `"Who goes with Fergus?\n"`, where `\n` is a newline character.

(b) `3.14e1L`
This is a floating-point literal in scientific notation:
- `3.14e1`: This means \( 3.14 \times 10^1 \), which equals `31.4`.
- `L`: The `L` suffix indicates that this literal is of type `long double`.

So, `3.14e1L` represents the value `31.4` as a `long double`.

(c) `1024f`
This is a floating-point literal with a suffix:
- `1024`: This is a simple integer.
- `f`: The `f` suffix indicates that the literal should be treated as a `float`.

So, `1024f` represents the value **`1024.0`** as a `float`.

(d) `3.14L`
This is a floating-point literal:
- `3.14`: A simple decimal floating-point number.
- `L`: The `L` suffix indicates that this literal is of type `long double`.

So, `3.14L` represents the value **`3.14`** as a `long double`.
