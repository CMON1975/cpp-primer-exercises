Is the following range `for` legal? If so, what is the type of `c`?

const string s = "Keep out!";
for (auto &c : s) { /* ... */ }

Yes, the range-based `for` loop is perfectly legal in C++.
* `auto &c` is a refrence to each character in the string `s`.
* the type of `c` is `char&` (a reference to a `char), because `string` stores a sequence of `char` elements.

In this loop, `c` represents a reference to each individual character of the string `s`,
allowing modification of the characters in the string directly if desired.
