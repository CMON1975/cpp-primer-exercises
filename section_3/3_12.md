**Exercise 3.12** Which, if any of the following `vector` definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
(a) `vector<vector<int>> ivec;` This is legal and creates a `vector` of an `int vector` named "ivec" with default initialization.
(b) `vector<string> svec = ivec;` This is illegal as "ivec" is of type `int` and does not match the type `string` of "svec".
(c) `vector<string> svec(10, "null");` This is legal and creates a `string vector` of 10 elements all initialized to "null".
