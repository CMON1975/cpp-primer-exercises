**Exercise 3.19:** List three ways to define a `vector` and give it ten elements, each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why.
```
vector<int> v1(10, 42);

vector<int> v2{42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42};

vector<int> v3;
for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
    v3.push_back(42);
```
The first method is preferred because it's concise, efficient, and clearly communicates the intent. The second method becomes cumbersome the more values there are, and is difficult to maintain through changes. Though the third method is explicit, it's rather verbose and can lead to unnecessary reallocations and copies.
