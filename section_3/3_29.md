**Exercise 3.29**: List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a `vector`.
1. **Fixed size**: An array is of a fixed size; we cannot add elements to an array. A `vector`, on the other hand, can dynamically resize itself as elements are added or removed.
2. **No bounds checking**: Arrays do not perform bounds checking, which means accessing an element outside the bounds of the array (e.g., `arr[-1]` or `arr[10]` for an array of size 10) can lead to undefined behavior. In contrast, `vector::at()` provides bounds checking and will throw an exception if the access is out of bounds.
3. **No element management**: Arrays do not manage their elements beyond basic memory allocation. For example, if you're storing objects in an array, you'll need to manually manage the construction and destruction of those objects. A `vector` handles this automatically, calling constructors and destructors as needed when elements are added or removed.
4. **No built-in methods**: Arrays lack the convenience of built-in functions that `vector` provides, such as `push_back()`, `size()`, `clear()`, and `resize()`. These methods make working with a `vector` more flexible and easier for common operations.
5. **No ability to pass size with the array**: When passing an array to a function, the size information is lost, meaning you must pass the size seperately. In contrast, a `vector` always knows its size via `vector::size()`.
6. **Harder to copy or assign**: Arrays down't support copy assignment or resizing the way `vector` does. To copy an array, you need to manually iterate over its elements. A `vector` supports copy and move semantics and provides a much easier way to duplicate or transfer ownership.
