Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the `string` input operator and in the `getline` function.
* `>>` Operator: Reads up to the first whitespace character and ignores any leading whitespace.
* `getline` Function: Reads until a newline (or a specified delimiter), including all whitespace characters, and stops at the delimiter without including it in the result.
