**Exercise 3.30:** Identify the indexing errors in the following code:
```
constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[arraysize];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
    ia[ix] = ix;
```
## Error 1: Incorrect Array Size Variable
* **Issue**: The array `ia` is declared with `arraysize`, but the variable is actually named `array_size`.
* **Impact:** This will cause a compilation error since `arraysize` is undefined.
**Correction:**
`int ia[array_size]`
## Error 2: Starting Index at 1 and Potential Out-of-Bounds Access 
* **Issue:** The loop initializaes `ix` to `1`, and runs while `ix <= array_size`. This means when `ix` equals `array_size` (which is `10`), the code tries to access `ia[10]`.
* **Explanation:**
    - In C++, array indices start from `0` and go up to `size - 1`.
    - Declaring `int ia[array_size];` creates an array with valid indices from `0` to `9`.
    - Accessing `ia[10]` when `ix` equals `10` is out-of-bounds and leads to undefined behavior.
* **Impact:**
    - Potential runtime errors, memory corruption, or crashes due to accessing memory outside the allocated array.
**Correction:**
- Adjust the loop to prevent out-of-bounds access.
- Start the loop with `ix = 0` and iterate while `ix < array_size`.
```
for (size_t ix = 0; ix < array_size; ++ix)
    ia[ix] = ix;
```
## Error 3: Skipping Initialization of `ia[0]`
- **Issue:** By starting the loop at `ix = 1`, the element `ia[0]` is never initialized.
- **Impact:**
    - If `ia[0]` is used elsewhere in the code, it may contain an indeterminate value, leading to incorrect behavior.
**Correction:**
- Start the loop at `ix = 0` to intialize all the elements of the array.
```
for (size_t ix =0; ix < array_size; ++ix)
    ia[ix] = ix;
```
