**Exercise 3.37:** What does the following program do?
```
const char ca[] = {'h','e','l','l','o'};
const char *cp = ca;
while (*cp) {
    cout << *cp << endl;
    ++cp;
}
```
1. The program will start by printing the characters in the array (`'h'`,`'e'`,`'l'`,`'l'`,`'o'`), each followed by a newline, as long as the loop iterates over valid characters.
2. Since the character array does not contain a null terminator, the loop condition (`while (*cp)`) will not terminate after reaching the end of the array.
3. The program will continue incrementing `cp` and accessing memory beyond the bounds of the array, leading to **undefined behavior**. This means the program might print garbage values (whatever happens to be in memory after the array) and potentially keep going indefinitely.
4. The loop will only stop if it accidentally encounters a null terminator (`\0`) in the memory after the array, which may or may not happen. In some cases, this could even cause a crash, depending on what memory is being accessed.
